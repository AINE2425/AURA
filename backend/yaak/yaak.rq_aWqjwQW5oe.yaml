      ["With the advent of Technology in the healthcare industry, there is a growth in revenue generation. Patients, doctors, insurance companies, and other entities are the key players in Healthcare Industry. Further effective and accurate back workplace method is urgently needed towards maintaining poise among the growing number of patients and the paperwork required for development plus insurance prerogatives, among other things. Hence, this concerns progressive mechanisation elucidations such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) being able to assist healthcare organisations in increasing effective proficiency, lowering expenses, and reducing the risk of human error once handling data such as doctor credentialing, staffing, and patient fitness, as well as medical record maintenance, payables and denial recover, and patient scheduling.", "Robotic process automation (RPA) is transforming the healthcare industry through the automation of jobs, optimisation of workflows, and improvement of operational efficiency. This chapter examines the revolutionary capacity of robotic process automation (RPA), emphasising its various uses, advantages, and ethical implications. Although RPA enhances the efficiency of resource allocation and enhances the quality of patient care, it is crucial to tackle concerns such as job displacement and data privacy. Empirical case studies provide concrete evidence of the tangible effects of robotic process automation (RPA) on the delivery of healthcare services. Anticipating and adopting the progress of robotic process automation (RPA) with ethical accountability holds the potential for a more streamlined and patient-focused healthcare system.", "An emerging technology breakthrough called robotic process automation (RPA) is being designed to alleviate users’ everyday responsibilities of tedious and monotonous operations. This technology presents the fraternity of researchers with a brand-new field of study, and several research investigations are now being conducted in this area. It isn’t robotics; rather, it represents completely distinct area of technology. Robotic process automation is a new as well as rapidly expanding area of robotic systems. This study highlights the significant features of robotic process automation (RPA) and its application in healthcare industry."], [ "Robotic Process Mining (RPM) leverages User Interface (UI) logs as a source of information to analyze the processes to be automated. These UI logs record user interactions with the graphical user interface of an information system during the execution of a process, encapsulating a large amount of data. However, despite the abundance of information captured in these logs, a considerable portion remains on the screen, whose structure is often inaccessible programmatically. This unstructured data poses a significant challenge, particularly the gap in the automatic extraction of UI hierarchies from desktop screenshots, which hinders the application of mining techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents (1) an approach that employs a multi-model detection system designed specifically for different levels of UI abstraction and (2) an algorithm to reconstruct the UI hierarchy in a tree data structure. The results of this approach demonstrate higher performance in terms of accuracy, recall, and efficiency compared to other existing detection techniques. These findings represent a substantial contribution to the field of automated process analysis, providing a solid foundation for future advances in RPA analysis.", "Transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a designer into computer code is a typical task conducted by a developer in order to build customized software, websites, and mobile applications. In this paper, we show that deep learning methods can be leveraged to train a model end-to-end to automatically reverse engineer user interfaces and generate code from a single input image with over 77% of accuracy for three different platforms (i.e. iOS, Android and web-based technologies).", "Detecting Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements in GUI images is a domain-specific object detection task. It supports many software engineering tasks, such as GUI animation and testing, GUI search and code generation. Existing studies for GUI element detection directly borrow the mature methods from computer vision (CV) domain, including old fashioned ones that rely on traditional image processing features (e.g., canny edge, contours), and deep learning models that learn to detect from large-scale GUI data. Unfortunately, these CV methods are not originally designed with the awareness of the unique characteristics of GUIs and GUI elements and the high localization accuracy of the GUI element detection task. We conduct the first large-scale empirical study of seven representative GUI element detection methods on over 50k GUI images to understand the capabilities, limitations and effective designs of these methods. This study not only sheds the light on the technical challenges to be addressed but also informs the design of new GUI element detection methods. We accordingly design a new GUI-specific old-fashioned method for non-text GUI element detection which adopts a novel top-down coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporate it with the mature deep learning model for GUI text detection.Our evaluation on 25,000 GUI images shows that our method significantly advances the start-of-the-art performance in GUI element detection."], [ "In the context of recommendation systems, there have been recent developments which propose quantum computing to improve both efficacy and efficiency in terms of time. Within this context, the existing problem of measuring and comparing the electric efficiency of both systems is key to understanding the benefits and disadvantages quantum solutions could provide within the recommendation systems realm.This is a problem because existing solutions only consider effectiveness and efficiency in terms of time taken to resolve recommendations, leaving aside the electrical consumption. To address this gap, we propose a comparison of traditional and quantum solutions to recommender systems, which would allow us to measure whether there is a significant difference between these types of solutions in terms of electricity consumption while maintaining effectiveness. This solution would be the first to quantitatively measure such differences, providing valuable insights into the potential application of quantum computing in real-world recommendation systems.", "The rising demand for high-quality movie recommendations in streaming services necessitates more efficient algorithms capable of handling large datasets. Traditional recommendation systems often struggle with long training times and high computational costs. This study introduces a novel movie recommendation system utilizing a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) to overcome these limitations. By leveraging quantum algorithms, QSVM enhances both the speed and accuracy of recommendations. Our approach involves collecting and preprocessing data, implementing classical SVM for baseline comparison, encoding data for QSVM, and executing QSVM using a publicly accessible IBM quantum computer. The results demonstrate that QSVM outperforms classical SVM, achieving a 96% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.9693, compared to the classical SVM’s 95.33% accuracy and 0.9641 F1 score. This signifies QSVM’s superior capability in handling complex datasets. Our findings highlight the potential of QSVM in movie recommendation systems, suggesting future research directions in quantum machine learning and its applications.", "Recommender systems are crucial in delivering personalized content and enhancing user satisfaction. This paper investigates the performance of various machine learning algorithms, classical neural networks (CNNs), and quantum neural networks (QNNs) for movie recommendations using the MovieLens-1 M dataset. Traditional approaches like random forest, K-means, and support vector machines (SVM) are evaluated against the newly proposed QNN models. Two distinct QNN architectures are introduced, leveraging the principles of quantum computing, such as superposition and entanglement, to enhance recommendation accuracy. The study demonstrates that the simple QNN architecture significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models and CNNs, reducing prediction errors by 6% in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The complex QNN model, while accurate, requires more computational resources compared to its simpler counterpart. This research highlights the transformative potential of quantum computing in recommender systems, offering unprecedented accuracy and personalization. Future research will focus on scalability, practical implementation of QNNs, and exploring their application across diverse domains."]]
